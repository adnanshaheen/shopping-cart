        The recent stock market crash has caused the XYZ stock to below its IPO value. The
        president of the company is however, very optimistic that the company fundamentals
        are strong and would like to encourage the employees to have faith in his leadership
        and volunteer for a 10% cut in salary (money is not everything, he says).
